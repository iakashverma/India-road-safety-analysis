## 🛣️ India Road Safety Analysis

India Road Safety Analysis is a data-driven project aimed at understanding and analyzing the trends, causes, and patterns of road accidents across India.
The goal is to uncover insights from road safety data to help policymakers, researchers, and citizens identify high-risk areas and develop effective preventive strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives

Analyze accident trends over the years across different states and regions.
Identify major causes and contributing factors behind road accidents.
Visualize accident severity by vehicle type, road condition, time of day, etc.
Build data-driven insights to support road safety awareness and policy planning.

🧠 Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on accident statistics.
Interactive visualizations for geographical accident trends.
Correlation analysis between road conditions, vehicle type, and casualties.
Predictive insights (optional) using machine learning models for severity prediction.

## 📈 Sample Insights

Two-wheelers account for the majority of accidents in urban areas.
Most accidents occur during evening peak hours (5 PM–9 PM).
Poor road conditions and weather contribute significantly to fatal accidents.
States like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh have the highest reported incidents.
